# ctf_scripts
A repository for various scripts I've written during CTFs or wargames

These are scripts that I might want to re-use for similar challenges or glance at when I'm trying to remember how I implemented something previously. You may find them helpful if you're looking for a general example of how to approach a specific challenge (though they're probably very far from the most efficient methods).
